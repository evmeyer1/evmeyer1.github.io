Well, I finally got around to putting this website together.
Now I owe Mr. Rowan a Twitter bot.
I am going to base the code off of my Last Bot @BursleyBoys on Twitter.
This bot would take in a account name and number of tweets to scrape.
It would then produce a tweet mimicking the account that it had scraped while following proper sentence structure.
We got Second Place in the competition.
